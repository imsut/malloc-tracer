malloc and free wrapper

USAGE:
 $ LD_PRELOAD=/somewhere/malloc_wrapper.so foobar

DESCRIPTION:
 With this wrapper working as preloaded module, a target application
 prints out memory allcation to a file.
 By analyzing the file, you can find memory leaks, if any, and the
 caller address of malloc where memory is not reclaimed.

 File sample is following.
   m 0x000000000213a2f0 0x0000000000000064 0x000000000040089c 0x00007f5595d5ea04
   f 0x000000000213a160
 where ...
   1st column: [m]alloc or [f]ree
   2nd column: address of memory region which is malloc-ed or free-ed
   3rd column: size of memory region malloc-ed (malloc only)
   the rest:   callstack (malloc only)


TODO:
 * some neat script which reads log file written by the wrapper
   and indicates memory leaks, if any.
